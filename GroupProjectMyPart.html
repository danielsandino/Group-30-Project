<br>
<br>
<b>Khanna</b> has an especially unique story. Let me take you back to 1995. In 1995, <b>Khanna</b> only existed in the minds of the bright founders of today's global known business. 
<br>
In San Antonio, Texas, David S, Arnold A, Tyler H, James L, and Everett Z were high school students. One day, they noticed that despite BBQ pork ribs prominence throughout 
<br>
the United States, they lacked the incredible taste and crispiness of great BBQ pork ribs. Working together, the 5 guys developed and tested their own <font size="4"><font color="brown"><font face="Calibri"><b>BBQ pork ribs</b></font></font></font>
<br>
recipe until it was unbelievably good. After holding a BBQ event after school, <b>Khanna's</b> founders realized the potential of their innovation, as the ribs were so good that they
<br>
sold out in less than an hour. By the time they graduated in 1998, <b>Khanna</b> had expanded throughout Texas and was starting to spread to other southern states, 
including 
<br>
Arizona, New Mexico, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. People across the United States were talking about this new startup <b>Khanna</b> and who was behind this genius idea.
<br>
However, Arnold, Tyler, James, Everett, and David made sure to maintain founder secrecy, not wanting any unwanted attention. They continued to grow as a company, 
<br>
opening 500 restaurants in 1999.
<br>
<br>
Then, in 2005, the 5 founders finally decided to reveal themselves publicly to the world while announcing the addition of their new products: <font size="4"><font color="brown"><font face="Calibri"><b>Texas Mac & Cheese and 
<br>
authentic BBQ sauce</b></font></font></font>. Customers throughout the entire US went crazy when this happened, in disbelief that the founders were so young. However, that didn't stop people from
<br>
running into <b>Khanna</b> restaurants to try their new products. By 2010, <b>Khanna</b> had fully expanded in the United States and was starting to open stores in Europe, Asia, and South <br>
America. People were talking about <b>Khanna</b> as word spread. However, although <b>Khanna</b> has grown incredibly since it first started, the focus of the business never 
changed. 
<br>
It has always about serving others and giving people the opportunity to enjoy delicious <b><font size="4"><font color="brown"><font face="Calibri">BBQ pork ribs, BBQ sauce, and Mac & Cheese</font></font></font></b>. 
Everyday, the 5 founders wake up 
<br>
to make people lives a little better, one person at a time, one BBQ pork rib at a time.
